50/50
------------------------

Your enhanced versions are great (though they use stuff like
value-returning functions, which we haven't covered yet, so I'm glad
you included the original versions, too).  But the thing I really like
is your thorough tallying of user inputs that cause the program to
behave badly.  That's great!

problem 1: Good.

problem 2: Good.

problem 3: The pseudocode in your IPO chart can look more code-like.
It seems like you made things maybe a little *less* clear by trying to
avoid writing code-list statements.  But it would be fine to write
something like:

If the magic value is equal to the year
   set the message to "This date is magic!"
Otherwise
   set the message to "This date is not magic."
Print the message

Using indenting as in Python to indicate the scope of each line is
generally understood.

problem 4: Good.
