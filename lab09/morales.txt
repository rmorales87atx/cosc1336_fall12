50/50
------------------------

problem 1: Looks good.

It's funny that you made a printf function.  I'm always typing that
and finding it lacking.  I really like your mechanism for handling
errors, too.  Much neater than all those loops.  If only we'd had time
to talk about exceptions...

problem 2: Great!
