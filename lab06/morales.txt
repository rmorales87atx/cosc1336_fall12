In general, avoid putting spaces in your file names (and directory
names if you are creating a multi-file project)

problem 1: Your program works great, but your input validation loop in
get_primary_color is a little more complicated than necessary, I
believe.  I'd write it like this:

def get_primary_color():
    result = input("Enter a primary color: ")
    while not is_valid_primary(result):
        print("Invalid entry...")
        result = input("Enter a primary color: ")
	
problem 2: Good.

problem 3: Good, though I'm confused by why you output part of the
triangle to stderr instead of stdout.  Very odd...

problem 4: Good.
