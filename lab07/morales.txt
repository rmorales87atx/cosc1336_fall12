49/50
------------------------

problem 1: Your enhanced version is quite tidy!

problem 2: Your TI-83 code is interesting.  I can see that it wasn't
very similar to the one we wrote.  It has the advantage that caching
all the primes is much faster than looping through all possible
numbers to see if they're prime.  But it does limit the size of the
number you can factorize.

problem 3: When I ran this one, I got an error at the end when the
print_stats function was called. (-1) It looks like the issue is that
you needed to pass in num_plays instead of count.

I find it less surprising that sym1 == sym2 == sym3 works, than things
like min < value < max.  But it's clear that the Python designers
spent a lot of time trying to make the comparators behave in an
intuitive way when they are chained together.
