50/50
------------------------

problem 1a: It's a good idea to choose test cases that don't happen to
evaluate to a whole number if your program should work with real
numbers.  Otherwise your program might appear to work correctly when
it is actually incorrect.  Since your program *did* work correctly on
such a test case, I'm not taking off any points, but I wanted to
mention it.  It's important to choose test cases that do a good job of
exercising your code.

Nice formatting!

problem 2: Very clear explanations.

problem 3: Excellent use of the named "constant"

problem 4: Good.
